			<p class="margin-top">The flow of how your device loads a webpage is simple. </p>
			<ol>
				<li>Your device sends a request to a server. Something like <code>https://dumbwebsite.com/webpage</code>.
					That means your web browser sends a request to whatever computer is linked to <code>dumbwebsite.com</code> and asks for <code>webpage</code>.
					They send back a bunch of content, and tell your browser where to get other necessary content from. For example, your browser may receive code that
					says the equivalent of "put the image at <code>https://dumbwebsite.com/image.png</code> at the top of the page." Ads work the same way. For example, the webpage
					might have code that says "get an ad from Google and place it at the side" (Most ads on websites are from Google).
				</li>
				<li>
					Your browser normally would go to Google, telling Google you're from dumbwebsite.com, and get the ad to display,
					and Google would put money into the account of the owner of dumbwebsite.com.
					This is where Charity Ads comes in. The extension blocks it, and replaces it with a new ad from charityads.net.
					This way, Google thinks the ads that are shown are from charityads.net, and places money into our account.
				</li>
				<li>
					This step's pretty simple. Each week we host a poll on Instagram for whichever charity people may want the money to go towards,
					and then we donate it!
				</li>
